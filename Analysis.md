# Wallet Credit Score Analysis

## Overview
This document provides an analysis of the credit scores assigned to wallets based on their transaction behavior in the Aave V2 protocol. The analysis includes score distribution and insights into wallet behavior across different score ranges.

## Score Distribution
The distribution of wallet scores is categorized into ranges as follows:
- 0-100
- 101-200
- 201-300
- 301-400
- 401-500
- 501-600
- 601-700
- 701-800
- 801-900
- 901-1000

*Note: The graph above illustrates the number of wallets falling into each score range.*

## Insights
### Low Score Range (0-300)
- Wallets in this range often exhibit risky behavior, such as:
  - High frequency of liquidation calls.
  - Frequent borrowing without adequate repayment.
  - Low transaction amounts, indicating potential bot-like behavior.

### Mid Score Range (301-700)
- Wallets in this range show a mix of responsible and risky behavior:
  - Moderate transaction frequency.
  - Balanced deposit and borrow actions.
  - Some wallets may be experimenting with the protocol.

### High Score Range (701-1000)
- Wallets scoring in this range demonstrate responsible usage:
  - Consistent deposit and repayment behavior.
  - Higher transaction amounts, indicating confidence in the protocol.
  - Longer wallet age, suggesting established users.

## Conclusion
The credit scoring model effectively differentiates between responsible and risky wallet behaviors. The insights gained from the analysis can help in understanding user behavior and improving the Aave V2 protocol's risk management strategies.

## Future Work
- Further refinement of feature engineering to enhance model accuracy.
- Exploration of additional machine learning algorithms for better performance.
- Continuous monitoring and updating of the model with new transaction data.
